# Introduction-to-Computer-Science
CS50X on HarvardX

The online version of Harvard's famous CS50 course for introductory computer science is CS50X on the edX platform. Topics covered include basic programming, functions, pointers, algorithms, and data structures in C, databases in SQL, and Python. Tracks at the end of the course include mobile app development in Java and XML for Android and for iOS in Swift, game development in Lua, and web development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flask, and SQL. Solutions to problem sets are included in this repository as follows: 

1. Basic loops (Mario) and operations (Cash and Credit)
2. An algorithm for reading level (Readability) and encryption (Caesar and Substitution)
3. Election tallying using plurality, runoff, and tideman algorithms
4. Image processing (Filter and Recover)
5. Spell-checking algorithms using a hash table
6. Versions of Mario, Cash, Credit, and Readability in Python, and a DNA short tandem repeat analysis algorithm
7. Use of SQL queries (Movies) and databases for sorting (Houses)
8. 8a. Basic app design (Pokedex, Fiftygram, Notes) in Java (note: the Swift counterpart is not included since it requires a Mac and Xcode)
8. 8b. Basic game design in Lua using the LOVE engine (Pong and Mario)
8. 8c. Basic web design (Homepage and Finance)

More information on the requirements for each problem set can be found at https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/.
